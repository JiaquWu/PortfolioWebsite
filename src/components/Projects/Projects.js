                  This game project is my thesis work for my Master's degree at the University of Skövde, and I finished the whole project and <a href="http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=4471&pid=diva2%3A1676937&c=1&searchType=SIMPLE&language=en&query=jiaqu&af=%5B%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=all" className= "purple bold-link">thesis</a> by myself, excluding the artwork. 
              <br></br>The game was originally designed to see if the player could understand the rules and get the "every life counts" message that I wanted to send to the player without providing explicit explanation of the rules to the player. Overall I spent more effort on the game design than on the programming.
